  Options Trading Tracker - Main HTML Entry Point
  
  This is the main HTML file for the Options Trading Tracker application.
  It serves as the entry point for the React-based single-page application (SPA).
  
  What this file does:
  - Provides the basic HTML structure for the React app
  - Defines the root div element where React components will be mounted
  - Loads the main TypeScript/React entry point (src/main.tsx)
  - Sets up basic meta tags for responsive design and SEO
  
  How to use:
  1. Development: Run `yarn dev` - Vite will serve this file with hot reload
  2. Production: Run `yarn build` - Creates optimized version in dist/ folder
  3. Preview: Run `yarn preview` - Serves the built production version
  
  Key elements:
  - #root: The DOM element where the entire React app mounts
  - src/main.tsx: Entry point that renders the App component
  - Vite handles module bundling, TypeScript compilation, and dev server
  
  Note: This file is processed by Vite during build time.
  Vite will inject additional scripts and optimize assets automatically.
