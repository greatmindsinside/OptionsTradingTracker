## Tasks Checklist

### Project Initialization

- [ ] Set up basic global styles and CSS architecture
- [x] Add sample CSV files in /public/sample-csv

### Git Workflow & CI/CD

- [x] Set up Git workflow and branch protection
- [x] Configure pre-commit hooks with Husky (lint, format, test:all)
- [x] Create branch naming conventions and PR templates
- [x] Create GitHub repository (options-trading-tracker)
- [x] Push initial commit to main and protect main branch
- [x] Configure GitHub branch protection rules
- [x] Set up README.md with Git workflow documentation
- [x] Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD with comprehensive test pipeline
- [x] Create issue and PR templates for GitHub
- [x] Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
- [x] Test complete Git workflow: branch â†’ all tests â†’ PR â†’ merge
- [x] Add license file (MIT recommended for open source)
- [x] Set up commit message conventions (Conventional Commits)

## Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ and yarn package manager
- GitHub account for repository hosting
- VS Code for development environment
- Git CLI tools properly configured
- Husky for Git hooks (automated)
- Playwright browsers for E2E testing
- Storybook for component development
- TypeDoc for API documentation

## Test Pyramid Strategy

- **Unit Tests (Vitest):** Pure functions, calculations, utilities, database operations
- **Component Tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):** React components, user interactions, state management
- **End-to-End Tests (Playwright):** Complete user workflows, CSV import â†’ analysis â†’ export
- **Accessibility Tests (axe-core + Playwright):** WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility
- **Integration Tests:** Database + UI workflows, multi-component interactions

## Git Workflow Requirements

- **Branch Strategy:** Feature branches from main, no direct main commits
- **Branch Naming:** `feat/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`, `docs/update-name`, `test/test-name`
- **Pre-commit Checks:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript compilation, full test suite
- **PR Requirements:** All checks pass, all tests pass, code review (if team), squash merge
- **Main Branch Protection:** Require PR, require status checks, require test passage, no force push

## Acceptance Tests

- [x] ESLint catches common TypeScript/React issues
- [x] Prettier formats code consistently on save
- [x] VS Code provides proper IntelliSense and debugging
- [ ] Environment variables load correctly in development
- [x] Path aliases resolve properly (@/components/...)
- [x] Error boundaries catch and display development errors
- [x] GitHub Actions CI passes on all PRs
- [x] All yarn scripts work correctly (lint, format, test)
- [x] Unit tests achieve >90% coverage on critical modules
- [x] Component tests cover user interactions and edge cases
- [x] E2E tests verify complete user workflows
- [x] Accessibility tests pass WCAG AA standards
- [x] Pre-commit hooks block commits with failing tests
- [x] Cannot push directly to main branch (protection enabled)
- [x] PR creation triggers comprehensive test pipeline
- [x] Merge requires all tests (unit/component/e2e/a11y) to pass

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Inconsistent code formatting across team/time
  - **Mitigation:** Prettier + ESLint integration, pre-commit hooks
- **Risk:** VS Code configuration inconsistencies
  - **Mitigation:** Workspace settings, recommended extensions file
- **Risk:** Environment variable management complexity
  - **Mitigation:** Clear .env examples, documentation in README
- **Risk:** CI/CD pipeline failures
  - **Mitigation:** Start simple, test locally first, gradual complexity
- **Risk:** Developers bypassing Git workflow
  - **Mitigation:** Branch protection, pre-commit hooks, clear documentation
- **Risk:** Merge conflicts from parallel development
  - **Mitigation:** Small PRs, frequent rebasing, clear branching strategy
- **Risk:** Test suite becoming slow and blocking development
  - **Mitigation:** Fast unit tests, selective E2E runs, parallel execution
- **Risk:** Accessibility regressions going unnoticed
  - **Mitigation:** Automated axe-core testing, manual accessibility reviews

## Demo Script

See [setup-demo.sh](../scripts/setup-demo.sh) for complete project initialization script.

## Strict Git Workflow Protocol

```bash
# FOR EVERY CHANGE - NO EXCEPTIONS

# 1. Start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes and test locally
yarn lint    # Must pass
yarn format  # Must pass
yarn test:all # Must pass
yarn build   # Must pass

# 4. Commit with conventional commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
# Pre-commit hooks automatically run full test suite

# 5. Push branch and create PR
git push -u origin feat/your-feature-name
gh pr create --title "Your Feature" --body "Description"

# 6. Wait for CI checks, merge when green
gh pr merge --squash

# 7. Clean up
git checkout main && git pull
git branch -d feat/your-feature-name
```
