### Frontend-First Approach

- **User Experience Priority**: Focus on visual impact and user workflow optimization
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable React components for rapid feature deployment
- **Mock-First Development**: Build UI with mock data first, connect APIs later
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface for on-the-go monitoring (Mark's priority)

### Backend Architecture (Development Team Scope)

- **API Integration Architecture**
  - Rate limiting & caching for news data APIs
  - Error handling and fallback systems

  - Lazy loading for complex visualizations
  - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
  - Background processing with web workers
- **Database Enhancements**
  - Time series data optimization
  - Indexing strategy for wheel queries
  - Data compression and backup systems
