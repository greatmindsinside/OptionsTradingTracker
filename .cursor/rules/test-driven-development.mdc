## Test-Driven Development Workflow

Before implementing any functionality, write comprehensive tests to define expected behavior. Follow this incremental workflow:

1. **Write tests first (commented out)**: Create all test cases that define the expected behavior, but keep them commented out initially.

2. **Incremental implementation and testing**:
   - Uncomment tests one at a time (or in small groups) as you implement functionality
   - Run tests frequently after each change to verify the implementation works
   - Make minimal changes to get the current test(s) to pass
   - Only move to the next test(s) once the current ones pass

3. **Benefits of this approach**:
   - Clear specification of requirements before implementation
   - Incremental validation ensures changes work as you code
   - Minimal changes reduce risk of breaking existing functionality
   - Better code quality and maintainability
   - Confidence in refactoring
   - Documentation of expected behavior through tests

**Key principle**: Run tests as you code to ensure each change works before proceeding to the next test or feature.
